## Rock Paper Scissor
* self made dataset using mdeiapipe to detect hand gesture
* training the data set with data augmentation
* augmentation included horizontal flip, rotation
* trained the dataset using convolutional nueral netork
* predicting the gesture using a live streaming video
* (dataset created should not to be overfitting)
